# OpenCV

The following repository contains few practice implementations to get familiarized with the opencv library. 

Implementations present are -
 
-> Face detection using haarcascade files.

-> Hand and eye detection using haarcascade files.

-> Image processing(erosion and dilation) and thresholding using opencv. 

-> Edges detecting using contour detection,masking and thresholding.

-> Table detection and segmentation using basic opencv operations.
